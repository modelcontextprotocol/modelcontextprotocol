## Security in the MCP Ecosystem

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables powerful integrations between AI systems and external resources,
making security a critical consideration for developers and operators. This section provides practical 
guidance for securing MCP implementations, covering authentication flows, authorization patterns, 
and common attack vectors specific to MCP deployments.

 For technical details on security best practices, also see our [security best practices specification](/specification/latest/basic/security_best_practices),
 which includes detailed mitigation strategies for threats like confused deputy attacks, token passthrough vulnerabilities,
 and session hijacking.
 
 We maintain an active [Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp) through HackerOne
 for security researchers, and encourage reporting security issues through [GitHub's security disclosure process](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/security)
 to help keep the MCP ecosystem secure.
