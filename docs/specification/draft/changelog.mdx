This document lists changes made to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification since
the previous revision, [2025-03-26](/specification/2025-03-26).

## Major changes

1. Removed support for JSON-RPC **[batching](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch)**
   (PR [#416](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/416))
2. Added support for [structured tool output](/specification/draft/server/tools#structured-content)
   (PR [#371](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/371))
3. Classified MCP servers as [OAuth Resource Servers](/specification/draft/basic/authorization#authorization-server-discovery),
   adding protected resource metadata to discover the corresponding Authorization server.
   (PR [#338](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/338))
4. Require MCP clients to implement Resource Indicators as described in [RFC 8707](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8707.html) to prevent
   malicious servers from obtaining access tokens.
   (PR [#734](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/734))
5. Clarified [security considerations](/specification/draft/basic/authorization#security-considerations) and best practices
   in the authorization spec and in a new [security best practices page](/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices).
6. Added support for **[elicitation](/specification/draft/client/elicitation)**, enabling servers to request additional
   information from users during interactions.
   (PR [#382](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/382))
7. Added support for **[resource links](/specification/draft/server/tools#resource-links)** in
   tool call results. (PR [#603](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/603))
7. Added support for **differential synchronization** with `get` methods and `changedIds` notifications:
   - Added [`tools/get`](/specification/draft/server/tools#getting-a-tool) method to retrieve individual tool definitions
   - Added [`resources/get`](/specification/draft/server/resources#getting-resource-metadata) method to retrieve individual resource metadata
   - Added [`prompts/getDefinition`](/specification/draft/server/prompts#getting-a-prompt-definition) method to retrieve individual prompt definitions
   - Enhanced `*_list_changed` notifications with optional `changedIds` parameter for efficient sync
8. Added support for **batch retrieval** in list methods to avoid N+1 query problems:
   - Enhanced [`tools/list`](/specification/draft/server/tools#listing-tools) with optional `names` parameter for batch retrieval
   - Enhanced [`resources/list`](/specification/draft/server/resources#listing-resources) with optional `uris` parameter for batch retrieval
   - Enhanced [`prompts/list`](/specification/draft/server/prompts#listing-prompts) with optional `names` parameter for batch retrieval
   - Added `listByIds` capability flags for servers to advertise batch retrieval support
