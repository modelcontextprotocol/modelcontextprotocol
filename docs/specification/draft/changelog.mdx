This document lists changes made to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specification since

## Major changes

1. Add **[postMessage transport](/specification/draft/basic/transports/postmessage)** for secure, zero-installation communication between browser contexts (iframes and popups). This transport enables new use cases including privacy-preserving edge computing, rich interactive UIs, and inverted architectures where applications provide tools to embedded AI clients.

2. Enhance authorization server discovery with support for [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html). (PR [#797](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/797))
