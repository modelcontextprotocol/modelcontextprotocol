---

<div id="enable-section-numbers" />

<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

## Overview

The Minimum Authorization Profile defines the baseline authorization requirements for HTTP-based MCP servers. This profile ensures basic security while maintaining simplicity for initial deployments.

## Profile Identification

This profile is identified by the URL:
```
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/server/standard-profiles/minimum-authorization-profile
```

## MCP Protocol Version
The minimum MCP protocol version required for any MCP Server to use this profile is "2025-06-18".

## HTTPS Transport
- MCP servers implementing this profile MUST use HTTPS
- HTTP connections MUST be rejected or redirected to HTTPS
- TLS version 1.2 or higher MUST be supported

## OAuth 2.1 support
- MCP Clients and Servers MUST use OAuth 2.1 for all authorization flows

## Protected Resource Metadata Discovery
- Servers MUST implement OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata ([RFC 8414](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414))
- Servers MUST respond with `WWW-Authenticate` header when the MCP Server responds with a HTTP status code 401 (Unauthorized).
- The `WWW-Authenticate` header MUST specify the relevant OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata (OPRM), as described in Section 5.1 of RFC 9728

## Protected Resource Metadata Content
The OPRM resource(s) published by the MCP Server MUST have the following characteristics:
- There should be at least one OPRM resource for the MCP Server. There MAY be separate OPRM resources for individual MCP Server tools or other primitives
- The OPRM resource MUST specify at least one authorization server
- The OPRM resource MUST specify at least one scope that is required to access the URL for which the OPRM was specified

## Token Validation
- MCP Servers MUST accept JWT format access tokens as defined in [RFC 9068](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9068))
- MCP Servers MUST reject all other format access tokens
- Access tokens MUST be validated on every request according to the procedure set forth in [Section 5.2 of OAuth 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3)
- MCP Servers MUST only receive access tokens in the `Authorization` Request Header, and reject any tokens received in query parameters
- MCP Servers MUST validate that tokens were issued specifically for them as the intended audience by matching the `aud` value in the token to its URL
