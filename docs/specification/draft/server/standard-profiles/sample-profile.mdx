<div id="enable-section-numbers" />

<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

## Overview

This file is a sample profile to demonstrate what a profile specification looks like. DO NOT use this profile in a real deployment.

## Motivation

Profiles are a new feature of MCP, and a sample profile helps profile developers get a jump start on writing one, understand the components and a point of reference to develop their own profile.

## Specification

In a real profile, this section MUST specify what the profile requires of MCP Servers that implement it. It MUST specify what the profile requires MCP Clients to do in order to use it.

### Language

The profile specification MUST follow the guidelines for writing specifications in the IETF publication [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and ensure that the specification is unambiguous to implement.

## Additional Sections

In a real profile, you MAY add additional sections such as Rationale, References, Acknowledgements, etc. to ensure the document is complete.
