<Info>**Protocol Revision**: draft</Info>

The Model Context Protocol enables the definition of a collection of behaviors and properties as Profiles. Standard Profiles are available through the Model Context Protocol, and anyone may define custom Profiles. MCP Servers can declare the profiles they support. MCP Clients can discover which profiles an MCP Server supports, request the use of specific profiles, and negotiate a mutually agreed profile to use within a session with the MCP Server.

## Profile Specification
Each Profile has a specification document that describes the profile in detail. The profile specification is a document written using best practices prescribed in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) that unambiguously specifies the characteristics of a profile.

### Profile URL

A profile specification is available at the URL that is used to uniquely identify the profile. For example:

```
https://mycompany.com/mycustomprofile-1.0
```

OR

```
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/standard-profiles/minimum-authorization-profile
```

### Standard and Custom Profiles
- Standard profiles are governed by the Model Context Protocol and stored in the "Standard Profiles" folder in the Server section of this specification. Standard profiles always have the profile URL prefix:
  ```
  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/<version>/server/standard-profiles/
  ```
- Any profiles available outside of the standard profiles location are called Custom Profiles.
- MCP Servers may simultaneously support a mix of standard and custom profiles.

### Profile Modification and Versioning
Once made available, Profiles MUST NOT be changed. In order to make changes to a Profile, the author MUST create a new version of the Profile, with its own Profile URL.

## Publishing Profiles
An MCP Server makes it possible for Clients to discover the profiles it supports as follows:

### ProfileSpec Object

A ProfileSpec object has the following fields:

- The location of the profile specification
- The minimum MCP version required to use that profile.

```TypeScript
interface ProfileSpec {
  "profileURL": string; 
  // The unique URL identifying the profile,
  // which is also location where the profile is specified.

  "minMcpVersion": string;
  // this is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format that identifies the MCP version.
}
```

### Profiles Declaration
The profiles supported by an MCP Server are available through the Profiles Declaration JSON format document that is an array of `ProfileSpec` objects:

```TypeScript
[ ProfileSpec, ProfileSpec, ...]
```

#### Default Profile
A default profile is one that the server uses if the client does not request a specific profile. The first `ProfileSpec` in the Profiles Declaratoin document is the Server's default profile.

### Well-known URL
The Profiles Declaration is made available by an MCP Server at its "well-known" location, as described in [RFC8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615). The file name for the MCP Profiles Declaration document is: `mcp-profiles`. Thus the well-known URL for the MCP Profiles Declaration is obtained by inserting the path:

```
/.well-known/mcp-profiles
```

betewen the "authority" component (i.e. the domain name or IP address and port) and any path component of the MCP Server's URL.

So for example, if your MCP server is located at: `https://mymcpserver.mycompany.com`, then the profiles declaration document is at: `https://mymcpserver.mycompany.com/.well-known/mcp-profiles`. If your MCP server is located at: `https://mycompany.com/mymcpserver`, then the profiles declaration document is at: `https://mycompany.com/.well-known/mcp-profiles/mymcpserver`.

### Backward compatibility
If this resource does not exist on the MCP Server, or if the document returned is empty, then the Client MUST assume that the MCP Server does not support Profiles.

## Profile Discovery
Before connecting to an MCP Server, an MCP Client MAY fetch the Serverâ€™s Well Known URI to understand which profiles the server supports (if any).

## Initialization With Profiles
The MCP Client makes an `InitializeRequest` based on its knowledge of which (if any) profiles the MCP Server supports.

### Requested Profiles

The `InitializeRequest` object has an optional `requestedProfiles` field, whose value is an array of profile URLs.

```TypeScript
interface InitializeRequest extends Request {
  method: "initialize";
  params: {
    protocolVersion: string;
    capabilities: ClientCapabilities;
    clientInfo: Implementation;
    requestedProfiles?: [string];  // Optional field to request specific profiles.
  };
}
```

If the Client has no opinion of which profile to use, it omits the `requestedProfiles` field from the `InitializeRequest`. Otherwise, the Client specifies one or more profiles in the value `requestedProfiles` field of the `InitializeRequest` it sends to the MCP Server. The order of the profiles in the array is the Client's order of preference of profiles.

### Selected Profile

The `InitializeResult` interface has an optional `profile` field:

```TypeScript
interface InitializeResult extends Result {
  protocolVersion: string;
  capabilities: ServerCapabilities;
  serverInfo: Implementation;
  instructions?: string;
  profile?: string;  // When present, this field specifies the selected profile.
}
```

The value of the `profile` field is the Profile URL of the selected Profile. If this field is omitted in the response, and the MCP Server has a Profiles Declaration, then the Client MUST assume that the MCP Server has chosen the default profile specified in its Profiles Declaration. If the MCP Server does not have a Profiles Declaration, then the `InitializeResult` MUST NOT have a `profile` field.

## Profile Negotiation

1. The Client discovers the profiles supported by an MCP Server, optionally by performing a `HTTP GET` on the MCP Server's well-known Profiles Declaration URL.
1. Based on its policies, the Client formulates the list of acceptable profiles and their order of preference.
1. The Client sends the `InitializeRequest` with `requestedProfiles` value with all profiles it could use in this specific instance, in the order of the Client's preference.
1. The server MUST choose one of the requested profiles, and include it in the `InitializeResult` response in the `profile` field.
1. If the server cannot support any of the `requestedProfiles` values, it MUST refuse the connection.

### Fallback Behavior

If the client does not specify a requestedProfiles value in the InitializeRequest, then:

- If the Server did not declare any profiles at its Well Known URL, it accepts the InitializeRequest, as a Server that does not support Profiles would be expected to behave.
- If the Server declared profiles in its Well Known URL, then the server uses the default profile.
