title: Introduction
description: "Get started with the Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
---

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:

- **A growing list of pre-built integrations** that your LLM can directly plug into
- **The flexibility to change** between different apps and take your context with you
- **Best practices for securing your data** within your infrastructure

## Looking for Advanced Topics?

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore our [**How-to Guides**](/docs/how-to-guides/sampling) for in-depth tutorials on advanced topics like authentication and deployment strategies. These guides provide detailed walkthroughs for specific use cases.

## Ready to Build?

MCP provides official **SDKs** in multiple languages including TypeScript, Python, Java, Kotlin, C#, and Ruby. See the [SDK documentation](/docs/sdk) to find the right SDK for your project. The SDKs handle the protocol details so you can focus on building your features.
