title: Extensions Overview
description: Optional extensions to the Model Context Protocol
---

Extensions allow the MCP ecosystem to evolve and experiment with new capabilities while maintaining core protocol stability.

## What are Extensions?

Extensions are optional additions to the Model Context Protocol that provide functionality or guidance for specific use cases without requiring changes to the core specification. An extension is appropriate when a new feature is either:

- **Experimental** - There is sufficient uncertainty about an approach that would make it premature for the core specification, OR
- **Scoped** - The functionality is useful to a significant subset of users (e.g., specific industries or use cases) but may not be broadly applicable

Extensions provide a way for the MCP community to officially formalize and recommend approaches to common problems without the long-term commitment or scrutiny needed for core protocol changes.

## Extension Types

MCP recognizes three categories of extensions:

| Type            | Description                                                                                                           | Governance                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Official**    | Maintained in MCP GitHub organization under `ext-` prefixed repositories                                              | Core maintainer review and approval required |
| **Recommended** | Community-developed extensions that are vetted by core maintainers and listed in the [registry](/extensions/registry) | Listed after review                          |
| **Unofficial**  | Developed independently without MCP oversight                                                                         | No MCP involvement                           |

### Official Extensions

Official extensions are maintained by the MCP core team and extension maintainers in repositories within the [modelcontextprotocol GitHub organization](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). These extensions:

- Follow the same [governance and contribution process](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance#processes) as the core protocol
- Are held to the same quality and documentation standards
- Use the `modelcontextprotocol.io` vendor prefix

### Recommended Extensions

Recommended extensions are community-developed but have been reviewed and endorsed by MCP maintainers. To be listed as recommended, an extension must:

- Demonstrate clear value to a significant subset of MCP users
- Meet quality and documentation standards
- Be actively maintained
- Not conflict with core protocol principles
- Use vendor-specific identifier prefixes

### Unofficial Extensions

Unofficial extensions are developed independently and may be used by any implementation. These extensions:

- Do not require MCP approval or review
- Use vendor-specific identifier prefixes
- Are used at implementers' own discretion
- May later become recommended or official extensions

## Extension Identifiers

All extensions are identified using a consistent format:

```
{vendor-prefix}/{extension-name}
```

**Examples:**

- `modelcontextprotocol.io/official-extension` (official)
- `example.com/custom-extension` (recommended or unofficial)
- `mycompany.io/proprietary-feature` (unofficial)

The `vendor-prefix` follows the same format and reservation rules as prefixes in [`_meta`](/specification/draft/basic#meta). Specifically, any prefix beginning with zero or more valid labels, followed by `modelcontextprotocol` or `mcp`, followed by any valid label, is **reserved** for MCP use.

The vendor prefix helps avoid naming collisions and clearly indicates the source and governance of an extension.

## Extension Negotiation

Extensions are negotiated during the MCP initialization phase through the `extensions` field within capabilities in the initialize request and response.

### How It Works

1. During initialization, clients declare supported extensions in the `extensions` field
2. Servers respond with their own supported extensions in their `extensions` field
3. Each extension specification defines whether support from both parties is required
4. Extensions may include optional configuration parameters

### Example: Client Initialization with Extensions

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-11-25",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": {
        "listChanged": true
      },
      "extensions": {
        "example.com/custom-extension": {
          "exampleSetting": "value"
        },
        "modelcontextprotocol.io/official-extension": {}
      }
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Server Response with Extensions

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-11-25",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "extensions": {
        "modelcontextprotocol.io/official-extension": {
          "serverConfig": "enabled"
        }
      }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### Extension Configuration

Each extension in the `extensions` object can have an associated configuration object:

- **Empty object `{}`**: Indicates support for the extension with default settings
- **Configuration object**: Provides extension-specific settings and parameters
- **Omission**: Extension is not supported

Implementations SHOULD:

- Ignore extensions they don't recognize
- Gracefully handle missing configuration parameters
- Validate configuration values before using them

For detailed protocol-level documentation on capability negotiation, see the [Lifecycle documentation](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle#extension-negotiation).

## Extension Repositories

Extension repositories are official repositories within the [modelcontextprotocol GitHub organization](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) with the `ext-` prefix. Each repository focuses on a specific area and is maintained by appointed maintainers.

| Repository                                                   | Description                                         | Maintainers                                                                                 |

## Using Extensions

### For Implementers

Extensions are **optional**. MCP clients and servers can choose which extensions to implement based on their requirements. When implementing an extension:

- Review the extension's specification carefully
- Declare the extension in the `extensions` field during initialization
- Check SDK documentation to see if the extension is supported
- Consider the extension's status (Draft, Approved, etc.)
- Implement proper handling for missing or unrecognized extensions

Extensions are negotiated through the [initialization exchange](/specification/draft/basic/lifecycle#extension-negotiation) during session initialization. Both client and server must declare support for an extension for it to be active in a session.

### SDK Support

MCP SDKs may provide built-in support for extensions. Check your SDK's documentation for:

- List of supported extensions
- How to enable/disable extensions
- Any SDK-specific configuration required

### For Specification Writers

If you're writing specifications that reference MCP, you may wish to reference specific extensions. When doing so:

- Clearly indicate that the referenced capability is an **extension**
- Link to the extension's specification
- Note that support for the extension is optional

## Proposing a New Extension

Extensions are proposed through the SEP (Specification Enhancement Proposal) process:

1. **Create a SEP** using the [SEP template](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/tree/main/seps) with Track set to "Extensions"
2. **Engage with maintainers** of the relevant extension repository or working group to build alignment
3. **Submit for review** following the standard SEP approval process
4. **Implement the extension** once approved, by creating a PR to the extension repository

See the [SEP guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) for detailed information about the SEP process and the extension governance model.

## Extension Governance

- **Extension Repository Maintainers** oversee extensions within their repository and ensure consistency and quality
- **Core Maintainers** retain authority over the extension system, including the ability to require changes, deprecate, or promote extensions to the core protocol

Extensions evolve independently of the core protocol, allowing for rapid iteration while maintaining protocol stability.
