<Info>Last updated: **2026-02-28**</Info>

This page describes our strategic priorities, with particular focus on what we expect **Working Groups** and **Interest Groups** to deliver. Our goal is to give the community clear direction and meaningful ownership over MCP's evolution.

<Note>

The ideas presented here are not commitments—we may solve these challenges differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.

## SEP Prioritization

This roadmap is also a signal for the [SEP process](/community/sep-guidelines). **SEPs that fall within the priority areas below will receive expedited review and have the highest chance of acceptance.** SEPs outside these areas are not automatically rejected, but contributors should expect longer review timelines and a higher bar for justification. Maintainer and reviewer capacity is finite, and we direct it toward work that advances the current strategic priorities.

If you are considering proposing a SEP, we strongly encourage you to first check whether it aligns with one of the areas below, discuss it in the relevant [Working Group or Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups), and use that group's support as part of your justification. SEPs that arrive with Working Group backing and a clear connection to the roadmap will move fastest.

## Priority Areas

### 1. Transport Evolution and Scalability

Streamable HTTP gave MCP a solid, production-ready transport, but operational experience has revealed gaps that make it challenging to operate at scale. We are improving this transport to address horizontal scaling, stateless operation, and middleware/proxy patterns.

**What we want to achieve:**

- **Next-generation transport**: evolve Streamable HTTP for large-scale deployments—true stateless operation across multiple server instances, well-defined session semantics, and better support for load-balanced environments.
- **Scalable session handling**: refine how sessions are created and resumed so that server restarts and horizontal-scaling events are transparent to connected clients.
- **MCP Server Cards**: define a standard for exposing structured server metadata via a `.well-known` URL, making servers discoverable by browsers, crawlers, and registries without requiring an active connection.

**Working Group focus:**

- The **Transports WG** is the primary owner: a series of SEPs covering the wire format, session model, and resumption protocol, plus updated conformance guidance for SDK authors.
- The **Server Identity WG** owns the Server Card format and its distribution mechanism, coordinating with the broader industry AI-catalog effort.

**What we will not be doing:**

- Introducing additional official transports. We want to keep the set small to protect ecosystem compatibility; the community should experiment via Custom Transports.
- Replacing Streamable HTTP with a REST-based transport. That level of disruption to existing servers is not justified at this time.

### 2. Agent Communication

MCP has become a foundation for agentic systems. The Tasks primitive (finalized in [SEP-1686](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1686)) gives agents a reliable call-now / fetch-later pattern, but that is only the beginning. We need to improve MCP's ability to serve real-world agent-to-agent use cases.

**What we want to achieve:**

- **Task improvements**: address edge cases and operational gaps that have surfaced since Tasks shipped—retry semantics, cancellation guarantees, expiry policies, and improved error reporting from long-running operations.
- **Partial and streamed results**: today there is no way to return partial output from a Task beyond progress notifications. Clients need a way to receive intermediate results from long-running operations, and eventually streamed text, audio, and video frames for interactive scenarios.
- **Large response handling**: when a tool call returns a very large payload it can pollute an agent's context window. We want mechanisms—for example, reference-based results—that let clients decide when and how to pull full payloads into context.

**Working Group focus — Agents WG:**

- Use cases, requirements, and SEPs refining Task lifecycle semantics (retry, expiry, cancellation).
- A SEP or extension proposal for large-response handling.
- A directional proposal for streaming results from long-running operations.

### 3. Governance Maturation

MCP has grown from a protocol specification into a multi-company open standard under the Linux Foundation. [SEP-1302](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1302) formalized Working Groups and Interest Groups, and [SEP-2085](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/2085) established succession and amendment procedures. The next step is giving the community real ownership and a clear path to leadership.

**What we want to achieve:**

- **Contributor Ladder**: a transparent progression from community participant → WG contributor → WG facilitator → lead maintainer → core maintainer, with explicit criteria at each step. This reduces dependence on a small number of individuals.
- **Increased agency for Working Groups**: WGs with a proven track record should be able to accept SEPs and publish extension updates within their domain without a full core-maintainer review cycle.
- **Working Group charters**: each WG maintains a public charter stating its scope, active deliverables, success criteria, and retirement conditions—reviewed at least quarterly.

**Working Group focus — Governance WG:**

- A SEP introducing the Contributor Ladder with nomination and review criteria for each level.
- Updated WG/IG lifecycle documentation adding charter requirements and a delegation model for WG-level SEP acceptance.

### 4. Triggers and Event-Driven Client Updates

Today, MCP clients learn about server-side state changes only by polling or holding an active SSE connection for notifications—which few servers implement. As servers integrate with external event systems and run increasingly long-horizon tasks, there is a growing need for servers to proactively notify clients that new data is available.

**What we want to achieve:**

- A standardized mechanism for clients to register callback endpoints (webhooks or other async-friendly primitives) that fire when server state changes. The mechanism must define appropriate ordering guarantees and work across all transports.

**Working Group focus:**

- We expect a dedicated **Triggers & Events WG** to form to own the trigger specification, working closely with the Transports WG and Agents WG on delivery semantics.

## On the Horizon

These areas have real community interest and in some cases active sponsored SEPs, but they did not clear the bar for core-maintainer-driven focus this cycle. We remain interested: SEPs here are welcome and will be reviewed, and if the community self-organizes a Working Group around one of these areas we will support and sponsor it—we just won't be actively standing one up ourselves right now.

- **Security & Authorization** — finer-grained least-privilege scopes, clearer guidance on avoiding OAuth mix-up attacks, secure credential management on both client and server, and a community-driven vulnerability disclosure program routed through the Linux Foundation. Sponsored work is already underway: [SEP-1932 (DPoP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1932) and [SEP-1933 (Workload Identity Federation)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1933).
- **Enterprise Readiness** — audit trails and observability, enterprise-managed auth (Cross-App Access) integrated with SSO providers, configuration portability across clients, and gateway/proxy patterns where clients don't connect directly to servers.
- **Extensions Ecosystem** — maturing the `ext-auth` and `ext-apps` tracks, investigating a Skills primitive for advertising composed capabilities, and first-class extension support in the registry.

## Validation

A protocol specification is only as good as the implementations that follow it. Alongside the areas above, we continue to invest in:

- **Conformance Test Suites**: automated verification that clients, servers, and SDKs correctly implement the specification, with coverage expanding alongside each new feature area.
- **SDK Tiers**: the tiering system introduced in [SEP-1730](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1730) gives developers a clear signal of which SDKs track the specification most closely.
- **Reference Implementations**: canonical implementations of new features—including the new transport and trigger mechanisms—to anchor community development and unblock early adopters.

## Get Involved

MCP's roadmap is built by its community. Here is how to contribute:

- **Join a Working Group or Interest Group**: see the [Working Groups & Interest Groups](/community/working-interest-groups) page and the [community communication channels](/community/communication) for how to connect with the groups active in each area above.
- **Propose or comment on SEPs**: review the [SEP guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) and open or weigh in on proposals.
- **Start an experimental extension**: per [SEP-2133](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/2133), any WG or IG can begin experimenting in an `experimental-ext-` repository before a formal SEP is required.
- **Contribute to the project**: read the [contributing guide](/community/contributing) for how to get involved with the specification, SDKs, and tooling.
