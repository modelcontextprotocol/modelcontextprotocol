This page describes our strategic priorities and what we expect **Working Groups** and **Interest Groups** to deliver against them.

<Note>

The ideas presented here are not commitments—we may solve these challenges differently than described, or some may not materialize at all. This is also not an _exhaustive_ list; we may incorporate work that isn't mentioned here.

## SEP Prioritization

**SEPs that fall within the priority areas below will receive expedited review and have the highest chance of acceptance.** SEPs outside these areas are not automatically rejected, but contributors should expect longer review timelines and a higher bar for justification—maintainer capacity is finite, and we direct it toward these priorities first.

If you are considering a SEP, check whether it aligns with one of the areas below, discuss it in the relevant [Working Group or Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups), and bring that group's backing with you. SEPs with WG support and a clear connection to the roadmap move fastest. See the [SEP guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) for the full process.

## Priority Areas

### 1. Transport Evolution and Scalability

Streamable HTTP gave MCP a production-ready transport, but running it at scale has revealed gaps around horizontal scaling, stateless operation, and middleware patterns.

**What we want to achieve:**

- **Next-generation transport**: evolve Streamable HTTP to run statelessly across multiple server instances and behave correctly behind load balancers and proxies.
- **Scalable session handling**: define how sessions are created, resumed, and migrated so that server restarts and scale-out events are transparent to connected clients.
- **MCP Server Cards**: a standard for exposing structured server metadata via a `.well-known` URL, so browsers, crawlers, and registries can discover a server's capabilities without connecting to it.

**Working Group ownership:**

- **Transports WG** owns the transport and session work: a series of SEPs covering the wire format, session model, and resumption protocol, plus conformance guidance for SDK authors.
- **Server Identity WG** owns the Server Card format and its distribution, coordinating with the broader industry AI-catalog effort.

We will **not** be introducing additional official transports this cycle. Keeping the set small protects ecosystem compatibility; the community should experiment via Custom Transports.

### 2. Agent Communication

The Tasks primitive ([SEP-1686](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1686)) gave agents a reliable call-now / fetch-later pattern. Running it in production has surfaced gaps in the lifecycle semantics that the **Agents WG** should close:

- **Retry semantics**: what happens when a task fails transiently, and who decides whether to retry.
- **Cancellation guarantees**: what state a task is left in when a client cancels, and whether servers must honor cancellation.
- **Expiry policies**: how long results are retained after completion, and how clients learn a result has expired.
- **Error reporting**: richer failure information from long-running operations than the current binary success/failure.

### 3. Governance Maturation

MCP has grown into a multi-company open standard under the Linux Foundation. [SEP-1302](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1302) formalized Working Groups and Interest Groups, and [SEP-2085](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/2085) established succession and amendment procedures. The next step is giving the community a clear path to leadership so the project does not depend on a small set of individuals.

The **Governance WG** should deliver:

- **A Contributor Ladder SEP** defining the progression from community participant → WG contributor → WG facilitator → lead maintainer → core maintainer, with explicit nomination and review criteria at each step.
- **A delegation model** allowing WGs with a proven track record to accept SEPs and publish extension updates within their domain without a full core-maintainer review cycle.
- **A charter template** that every WG maintains publicly: scope, active deliverables, success criteria, and retirement conditions, reviewed quarterly.

### 4. Triggers and Event-Driven Client Updates

Clients currently learn about server-side state changes by polling or by holding an SSE connection open for notifications—and few servers implement the latter. As servers integrate with external event systems and run long-horizon tasks, they need a way to proactively notify clients that new data is available.

We want a standardized mechanism for clients to register callback endpoints—webhooks or similar—that fire on server state changes. It must define ordering guarantees and work across all transports. We expect a dedicated **Triggers & Events WG** to form around this, coordinating with the Transports WG on delivery and the Agents WG on how triggers interact with Tasks.

## On the Horizon

These areas have real community interest—and in some cases sponsored SEPs—but did not make the top priorities this cycle. We will support a community-formed Working Group in any of them; we are just not standing one up ourselves.

- **Result Type Improvements** — tool calls, resource reads, and task results all arrive complete and inline. Streamed results would let clients receive output incrementally for interactive scenarios (generated text, audio, video frames); reference-based results would let clients decide when to pull large payloads into context rather than polluting it by default. This is cross-cutting: streaming touches transport, references touch the schema.
- **Security & Authorization** — finer-grained least-privilege scopes, clearer guidance on avoiding OAuth mix-up attacks, secure credential management on both client and server, and a community-driven vulnerability disclosure program routed through the Linux Foundation. Sponsored work is already underway: [SEP-1932 (DPoP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1932) and [SEP-1933 (Workload Identity Federation)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1933).
- **Enterprise Readiness** — enterprises deploying MCP at scale are asking for audit trails, SSO-integrated auth (Cross-App Access), configuration portability across clients, and well-defined gateway/proxy patterns. We expect much of this to land as extensions rather than core specification changes.
- **Extensions Ecosystem** — the `ext-auth` and `ext-apps` tracks are early proof that the extension mechanism works. Maturing them, investigating a Skills primitive for composed capabilities, and adding first-class extension support to the registry would all strengthen the path from experiment to standard.

## Validation

A protocol specification is only as good as the implementations that follow it. Alongside the areas above, we continue to invest in:

- **Conformance Test Suites**: automated verification that clients, servers, and SDKs correctly implement the specification, with coverage expanding alongside each new feature area.
- **SDK Tiers**: the tiering system introduced in [SEP-1730](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/1730) gives developers a clear signal of which SDKs track the specification most closely.
- **Reference Implementations**: canonical implementations of new features—including the new transport and trigger mechanisms—to anchor community development and unblock early adopters.

## Get Involved

MCP's roadmap is built by its community:

- **Join a Working Group or Interest Group**: see the [Working Groups & Interest Groups](/community/working-interest-groups) page and the [community communication channels](/community/communication) to connect with the groups active in each area above.
- **Propose or comment on SEPs**: review the [SEP guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines) and open or weigh in on proposals.
- **Start an experimental extension**: [SEP-2133](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/2133) lets any WG or IG experiment in an `experimental-ext-` repository before a formal SEP is required.
- **Contribute to the project**: read the [contributing guide](/community/contributing) for how to get involved with the specification, SDKs, and tooling.
