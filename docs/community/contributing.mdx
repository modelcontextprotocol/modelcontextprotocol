description: How to contribute to the Model Context Protocol project
---

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open source project that welcomes contributions from the community. This guide walks you through everything you need to get started.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed and ready:

- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** - For version control (available via platform-specific package managers or OS distributions) and being able to check out and contribute specification contents and documentation
- **[Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)** - Required for building and testing our projects
- **npm** - Comes with Node.js, used for dependency management
- **[GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)** - For submitting pull requests and issues
- **Language-specific tooling** - If contributing to an SDK, you'll need the appropriate development environment for that language (e.g., Python, Rust, Go)

To check that you have all the basic tools available, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node --version  # Should be 18.x or higher
npm --version   # Should be 8.x or higher
git --version   # Any recent version
```

<Note>
These commands work the same on macOS, Linux, and Windows, so you're good to go on any platform.
</Note>

### Understanding the Repository Structure

MCP spans multiple repositories in the [`modelcontextprotocol`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) organization on GitHub. Here are a few notable sub-projects worth checking out: 

| Repository                                                                                                  | Contents                  |

Throughout this guide, **specification repository** refers to `modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol`, which contains the protocol spec, this documentation site, and [Spec Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)](/community/sep-guidelines).

### Understanding Project Roles

MCP follows a [governance model](/community/governance) with different levels of responsibility:

- **Contributors** - Anyone who files issues, submits PRs, or participates in discussions (that's you!)
- **Maintainers** - Steward specific areas like SDKs, documentation, or [Working Groups](/community/working-interest-groups)
- **Core Maintainers** - Guide overall project direction, review SEPs, and oversee the specification

You can find the current list of maintainers in the [`MAINTAINERS.md`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) file.

Maintainers are here to help you succeed! Don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or need guidance on your contribution.

## Your First Contribution

Start here if you are new to MCP and contributing to its ecosystem.

<Note>
While we use the specification repository as an example, the key patterns are applicable to other MCP repos as well.
</Note>

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, set up the basics in your **local environment**. This will give you the ability to test and validate changes without worrying about breaking anything in the production repositories.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the repository">
    Click the **Fork** button on the [repository page](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) to create your own copy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone your fork">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/modelcontextprotocol.git
    cd modelcontextprotocol
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify everything works">
    ```bash
    npm run check
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

If `npm run check` fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

While a lot of the items you might see tracked in the repository can feel intimidating, especially for newcomers, there are plenty of places where you can start with your first improvements: 

1. **Documentation improvements** - Help us fix typos, unclear explanations, broken links, or incomplete examples
2. **Issues labeled `good first issue`** - Tackle issues tagged in the [specification repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) as well as our SDK repos
3. **Schema examples** - Add examples to `schema/draft/examples/` to make it easier for developers to understand protocol primitives

### Step 3: Make Your Change

To make sure that we can review your change, you will need to create it in your own Git branch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a branch">
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-description
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the relevant files in your local copy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run checks">
    ```bash
    npm run check
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Commit with a clear message">
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Fix typo in tools documentation"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

Once you are ready to have your change reviewed by the MCP maintainer team, you will need to create a GitHub pull request.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Push your branch">
    ```bash
    git push origin fix/your-description
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a PR on GitHub">
    You can use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to make this process easier:
    ```bash
    gh pr create --fill
    ```
    Alternatively, navigate to your fork on GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in the PR template">
    Provide a clear description of your changes and link any related issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for review">
    Maintainers typically respond within 1-5 business days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
That's it, **congratulations on your first contribution**! Every improvement, no matter how small, helps make MCP better for everyone.
</Tip>

### What Makes a Good Contribution

As with any contributions, we want to make sure that the team reviews them quickly and is able to validate the changes. Here are a few examples that will help you make sure that your contribution is in good shape prior to the review:

| Harder to Review                              | Thoughtful and Impactful                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Large PR with unrelated changes               | Focused PR addressing one issue                       |
| Reformatting code without functional changes  | Fixing a bug with a clear explanation                 |
| Vague commit messages ("fixed stuff")         | Descriptive commits linking to issues                 |
| Changes without testing or verification       | Includes `npm run check` output confirming no breaks  |
| Submitting with failing CI checks             | All CI tests pass before requesting review            |
| Duplicating existing documentation            | Documenting an undocumented feature or edge case      |

## Types of Contributions

Different types of contributions may follow different processes. To make sure that we avoid frustrating back-and-forth converastions, here are some recommended approaches to tackling changes depending on their scope.

<Tip>
Not sure which category your change falls into? Ask in the [MCP Contributor Discord](/community/communication#discord) before starting any significant work.
</Tip>

### Small Changes (Direct PR)

Simply submit a pull request directly to the repo for:

- Bug fixes and typo corrections
- Documentation improvements, such as bringing clarity to an ambiguous or unclear section
- Adding examples to existing features
- Minor schema fixes that don't materially change the specification or SDK behavior
- Test improvements

### Major Changes (SEP Required)

Anything that changes the MCP specification requires following the [Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)](/community/sep-guidelines) process. This includes, but is not limited to:

- New protocol features or API methods
- Breaking changes to existing behavior
- Changes to the message format or schema structure
- New interoperability standards
- Governance or process changes

Here are a few concrete examples of what would require following the SEP steps:

- Adding a new RPC method like `tools/execute`
- Changing how authentication and authorization works
- Adding a new capability negotiation field
- Modifying the transport layer specification

## Working with the Specification Repository

Once you've determined [what type of contribution](#types-of-contributions) you're making, here's how to work with the specification repository.

### Schema Changes

The TypeScript schema (`schema/draft/schema.ts`) is the **source of truth** for the protocol. It
defines every message type, request/response structure, and primitive (tools, resources, prompts)
that clients and servers exchange. SDK implementers across all languages rely on this schema to
build conformant implementations.

When you run `npm run generate:schema`, it generates:

- The JSON schema (`schema/draft/schema.json`) for validation
- The Schema Reference documentation (`docs/specification/draft/schema.mdx`)

To modify the schema:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Edit the TypeScript schema">
    Make your changes in `schema/draft/schema.ts`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add examples (optional)">
    Add JSON examples in `schema/draft/examples/[TypeName]/` (e.g., `Tool/my-example.json`).
    Reference them in the schema using `@includeCode` JSDoc tags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate JSON schema and docs">
    ```bash
    npm run generate:schema
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate your changes">
    ```bash
    npm run check
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Documentation Changes

Documentation helps developers understand how to use MCP, build clients and servers, and integrate
the protocol into their applications. Clear documentation lowers the barrier to adoption and reduces
questions in support channels.

Docs are written in [MDX format](https://mdxjs.com/) (Markdown with JSX components) and powered by
[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/). The `docs/` directory contains:

- `docs/docs/` - Guides and tutorials for getting started and building with MCP
- `docs/specification/` - Formal protocol specification (versioned by date)

Here is how you can contribute to our documentation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the local docs server">
    ```bash
    npm run serve:docs
    ```
    This launches a live preview at `http://localhost:3000` with hot reloading.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make your changes">
    Edit the relevant `.mdx` files. You can use Mintlify components like `<Note>`, `<Tip>`,
    `<Steps>`, and `<Card>` for richer formatting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for issues">
    ```bash
    npm run check:docs
    ```
    This validates formatting, broken links, and other common issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Major Protocol Changes

For significant changes, follow the [SEP process](/community/sep-guidelines). Prior to spending a lot of time on a spec proposal, make sure to follow these best practices.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate your idea first">
    Discuss in an [Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build a prototype">
    Demonstrate practical application of your idea.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find a sponsor">
    A maintainer from the [maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) who will champion your proposal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write the SEP">
    Follow the [SEP Guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with the SDK Repositories

MCP maintains official SDKs in multiple languages, making it easy for developers to build clients
and servers for their preferred platform. SDK contributions of any kind are highly valued, regardless of whether you're fixing
bugs, improving performance, adding features, or enhancing documentation.

<Note>
Each SDK has its own repository, maintainers, and contribution guidelines. Some SDKs are maintained
in collaboration with larger partner organizations, such as Google, Microsoft, JetBrains, and others, so
processes may vary slightly between repositories.
</Note>

### Before Contributing to an SDK

To ensure a smooth contribution process and respect maintainers' time, follow these steps before
diving into code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open an issue first">
    Before starting significant work, open an issue to discuss your approach. This helps avoid
    duplicate effort, ensures your contribution aligns with the SDK's direction, and gives
    maintainers a chance to provide early feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Join the SDK channel">
    Find the relevant channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#python-sdk-dev`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the SDK's CONTRIBUTING.md">
    Each repository has its own `CONTRIBUTING.md` with specific instructions for setting up your
    development environment, coding standards, commit message conventions, and PR requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write tests">
    All contributions should include appropriate test coverage. Bug fixes should include a test
    that reproduces the issue, and new features should have tests covering the expected behavior.
    This helps maintain SDK reliability and prevents regressions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Help

### Communication Channels

Got questions or need guidance? The MCP community is here to help. Choose the channel that best fits your needs.

- **[Discord](/community/communication#discord)** - Real-time discussion with contributors and maintainers, focused on MCP contributions (not general MCP support)
- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions)** - Longer-form questions and proposals
- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues)** - Bug reports and feature requests

For protocol discussions, join [Working Group](/community/working-interest-groups) channels like `#auth-wg` or `#server-identity-wg`.

For SDK help, find your language's channel (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`).ßß

### Finding a Sponsor for SEPs

A **sponsor** is a Core Maintainer or Maintainer who champions your SEP through the review process.
They provide feedback, help refine your proposal, and present it at Core Maintainer meetings.

<Warning>
Every SEP needs a sponsor to move forward. SEPs that don't find a sponsor within 6 months are marked
as **dormant**. Dormant SEPs aren't rejected outright - they can be revived later if a sponsor is found
or the proposal is re-assessed to be needed.
</Warning>

To find a sponsor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find relevant maintainers">
    Look at the [maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) to find maintainers working in your area.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag maintainers in your PR">
    Tag 1-2 relevant maintainers (don't spam everyone).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share in Discord">
    Post your PR in the relevant Discord channel to increase visibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up if needed">
    If no response after 2 weeks, ask in `#general` or reach out to a Core Maintainer.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Maintainers review open proposals regularly, but response time varies based on complexity and availability.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things don't go as planned - that's completely normal! Here are solutions to common issues.
If you're still stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help in [Discord](/community/communication#discord).
The community is friendly and happy to help you get unstuck.

### `npm run check` fails

Common causes:

- **Wrong Node.js version** - Ensure you have Node.js 18+
- **Missing dependencies** - Run `npm install` again
- **Schema out of sync** - Run `npm run generate:schema`
- **Formatting issues** - Run `npm run format` to auto-fix

### My PR has been sitting unnoticed for weeks

1. Ensure all CI checks pass
2. Politely ping the desired reviewer in a comment
3. Ask in the relevant Discord channel
4. For urgent issues, reach out to a Core Maintainer

### I can't find a sponsor for my SEP

1. Make sure your idea has been discussed in Discord or an Interest Group first
2. Proposals with demonstrated community interest are more likely to find sponsors
3. Consider whether your change might be too large - could it be split into smaller SEPs?

### My SEP was rejected

Don't take it personally - a SEP rejection doesn't mean your idea was bad. SEPs can be rejected for
many reasons: timing, scope, competing priorities, or simply because the protocol isn't ready for
that change yet. The feedback you receive is valuable and often points toward a path forward.

Rejection is not permanent. You have a few options ahead:

1. **Address the feedback and resubmit** - Often, rejection comes with specific concerns. Addressing
   those concerns and resubmitting can be the right path forward.
2. **Discuss in Discord** - Talk with maintainers to better understand the concerns. Sometimes a
   brief conversation reveals a simpler path forward.
3. **Try a different approach** - Submit a new SEP that addresses the same problem differently,
   incorporating what you learned.
4. **Wait for the right moment** - Circumstances change. New use cases emerge, the community grows,
   and priorities shift. An idea rejected today might be welcomed tomorrow.

## Out of Scope

This guide covers contributions to the **core MCP project** - the specification, official SDKs, and documentation.

Building your own MCP servers, clients, or tools is **not** covered here. For guidance on building with MCP, see our documentation:

- [Build a Server](/docs/develop/build-server)
- [Build a Client](/docs/develop/build-client)
- [Example Servers](/examples)

If you build something you'd like to share with the community, you can submit it to the [community servers list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) by opening a PR to add your server to the README.

## AI Contributions

We welcome the use of AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT to help with your contributions! If you do use
AI assistance, just let us know in your pull request or issue - a quick note about how you used it (drafting
docs, generating code, brainstorming, etc.) is all we need.

The key is that you understand and can stand behind your contribution:

- **You get it** - You understand what the changes do and can explain them
- **You know why** - You can articulate why the change is needed
- **You've verified it** - You've tested or validated that it works as intended

You can read more about our stance in [our spec contribution guidelines](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-contributions).
