description: How to contribute to the Model Context Protocol project
---

The Model Context Protocol is an open-source project that welcomes contributions from the community. This guide walks you through everything you need to get started.

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

- **Git** - For cloning repositories and submitting changes
- **Node.js 18+** - Required for building and testing ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** - Comes with Node.js, used for dependency management
- **A GitHub account** - For submitting pull requests and issues

Verify your setup:

```bash
node --version  # Should be 18.x or higher
npm --version   # Should be 8.x or higher
git --version   # Any recent version
```

### Understanding the Repository Structure

MCP spans multiple repositories. Here's where things live:

| Repository                                                                                                | Contents                                       | When to Use                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| [modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol) | Specification, documentation, SEPs, governance | Protocol changes, docs, SEPs |
| [modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)             | TypeScript/JavaScript SDK                      | TS/JS SDK improvements       |
| [modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)                     | Python SDK                                     | Python SDK improvements      |
| Other SDK repos                                                                                           | Go, Kotlin, Java, C#, Swift, Rust, Ruby, PHP   | Language-specific SDKs       |

The **specification repository** (`modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol`) contains the protocol spec, this documentation site, and SEPs. When this guide says "specification repository," it always means this repo.

## Your First Contribution

New to open source or MCP? Start here.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the specification repository
git clone https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol.git
cd modelcontextprotocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify everything works
npm run check
```

If `npm run check` fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below.

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

Good places to find beginner-friendly work:

1. **Documentation improvements** - Typos, unclear explanations, broken links
2. **Issues labeled `good first issue`** - In the [specification repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or any SDK repo
3. **Schema examples** - Add examples to `schema/draft/examples/`

### Step 3: Make Your Change

1. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-description`
2. Make your changes
3. Run checks: `npm run check`
4. Commit with a clear message: `git commit -m "Fix typo in tools documentation"`

### Step 4: Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your branch: `git push origin fix/your-description`
2. Open a PR on GitHub
3. Fill in the PR template
4. Wait for review (typically 1-5 business days)

### Example: Good First Contributions

Here are examples of successful first contributions:

- **Documentation fix**: Clarifying a confusing paragraph
- **Schema example**: Adding a JSON example for a tool type
- **Typo correction**: Fixing spelling or grammar

## Types of Contributions

### Small Changes (Direct PR)

Submit a pull request directly for:

- Bug fixes and typo corrections
- Documentation clarifications
- Adding examples to existing features
- Minor schema fixes that don't change behavior
- Test improvements

**Examples of small changes:**

- Fixing a broken link in documentation
- Correcting a typo in an error message
- Adding a missing example to schema documentation
- Clarifying ambiguous wording

### Major Changes (SEP Required)

You must submit a [Specification Enhancement Proposal (SEP)](/community/sep-guidelines) for:

- New protocol features or API methods
- Breaking changes to existing behavior
- Changes to the message format or schema structure
- New interoperability standards
- Governance or process changes

**Examples of major changes:**

- Adding a new RPC method like `tools/execute`
- Changing how authentication works
- Adding a new capability negotiation field
- Modifying the transport layer specification

**Not sure which category?** Ask in the [MCP Contributor Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) before starting significant work.

## Contributing to the Specification

The MCP specification lives in the [specification repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol).

### Schema Changes

The TypeScript schema is the source of truth. To modify the schema:

1. Edit `schema/draft/schema.ts`
2. Generate JSON schema and docs:
   ```bash
   npm run generate:schema
   ```
3. Validate your changes:
   ```bash
   npm run check
   ```

### Documentation Changes

Documentation is written in MDX format in the `docs/` directory.

```bash
# Start local docs server
npm run serve:docs

# Check documentation for issues
npm run check:docs
```

### Major Protocol Changes

For significant changes, follow the SEP process:

1. **Validate your idea first** - Discuss in an [Interest Group](/community/working-interest-groups) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX)
2. **Build a prototype** - Demonstrate practical application
3. **Find a sponsor** - A maintainer from the [maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) who will champion your proposal
4. **Write the SEP** - Follow the [SEP Guidelines](/community/sep-guidelines)

## Contributing to SDKs

MCP maintains official SDKs in multiple languages. Each SDK has its own repository with specific contribution guidelines.

### Before Contributing to an SDK

1. **Open an issue first** - Discuss your approach before starting significant work
2. **Join the SDK channel** - Find the relevant channel in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX) (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`, `#python-sdk-dev`)
3. **Read the SDK's CONTRIBUTING.md** - Each repo has specific setup and coding standards
4. **Write tests** - All contributions should include appropriate test coverage

## Getting Help

### Communication Channels

- **[Discord](https://discord.gg/6CSzBmMkjX)** - Real-time discussion with contributors and maintainers
- **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/discussions)** - Longer-form questions and proposals
- **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues)** - Bug reports and feature requests

For protocol discussions, join Working Group channels like `#auth-wg` or `#server-identity-wg`. For SDK help, find your language's channel (e.g., `#typescript-sdk-dev`).

### Finding a Sponsor for SEPs

If you're submitting a SEP and need a sponsor:

1. Look at the [maintainer list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) to find maintainers working in your area
2. Tag 1-2 relevant maintainers in your PR (don't spam everyone)
3. Share your PR in the relevant Discord channel
4. If no response after 2 weeks, ask in `#general` or reach out to a Core Maintainer

Maintainers review open proposals regularly, but response time varies based on complexity and availability.

## Troubleshooting

### `npm run check` fails

Common causes:

- **Wrong Node.js version** - Ensure you have Node.js 18+
- **Missing dependencies** - Run `npm install` again
- **Schema out of sync** - Run `npm run generate:schema`
- **Formatting issues** - Run `npm run format` to auto-fix

### My PR has been sitting for weeks

1. Ensure all CI checks pass
2. Politely ping the reviewer in a comment
3. Ask in the relevant Discord channel
4. For urgent issues, reach out to a Core Maintainer

### I can't find a sponsor for my SEP

1. Make sure your idea has been discussed in Discord or an Interest Group first
2. Proposals with demonstrated community interest are more likely to find sponsors
3. Consider whether your change might be too large - could it be split into smaller SEPs?
4. SEPs without a sponsor after 6 months are marked as `dormant` (not rejected - you can revive them later with renewed interest)

### My SEP was rejected

Rejection is not permanent. You can:

1. Address the feedback and resubmit
2. Discuss the rejection in Discord to understand concerns
3. Submit a competing SEP with a different approach
4. Wait for circumstances to change (new use cases, community growth)

## Out of Scope

This guide covers contributions to the **core MCP project** - the specification, official SDKs, and documentation.

Building your own MCP servers, clients, or tools is **not** covered here. For guidance on building with MCP, see:

- [Build a Server](/docs/develop/build-server)
- [Build a Client](/docs/develop/build-client)
- [Example Servers](/examples)

If you build something you'd like to share with the community, you can submit it to the [community servers list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) by opening a PR to add your server to the README.

## AI Contributions

If you use AI assistance (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT) when contributing, disclose this in your pull request. Include the extent of AI usage - whether for documentation, code generation, or other purposes.

Contributions should demonstrate:

- **Human understanding** - You personally understand what the changes do
- **Clear rationale** - You can explain why the change is needed
- **Concrete evidence** - Include test cases or examples that demonstrate the improvement

## Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect respectful, professional, and inclusive interactions across all channels.
