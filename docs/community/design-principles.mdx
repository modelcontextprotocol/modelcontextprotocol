title: Design Principles
description: The core design principles that guide the development of the Model Context Protocol.
---

These principles guide how we evaluate protocol proposals, weigh tradeoffs, and evolve MCP. They reflect lessons from building and maintaining the project. They are meant as guidance by and for the community when developing [Spec Enhancement Proposals](/community/sep-guidelines) (SEPs) and [extensions](/extensions/overview).

## Convergence over choice

MCP favors convergence over optionality. Rather than supporting multiple approaches that fragment the ecosystem, we choose one well-designed path — accepting harder decisions upfront to deliver a more cohesive protocol.

We are careful in considering new features in MCP, but lean into experimentation via [extensions](/community/seps/2133-extensions).

## Composability over specificity

MCP provides foundational primitives: resources, tools, prompts, and tasks. We don't add protocol features for use cases that can be constructed from these existing building blocks. This keeps the surface area small and implementations simple.

When someone asks why MCP doesn't support a feature directly, the answer is usually that it can be built from what MCP already provides. Extensions like [MCP Apps](/extensions/apps/overview) capture the patterns that emerge.

## Stability over velocity

Adding to a protocol as widely adopted as MCP is easy; removing from it is nearly impossible. Every addition becomes a permanent commitment, and every addition is cost for client implementers to support. We move deliberately, accepting that "no" today leaves the door open while "yes" closes it forever.

Contributors accustomed to rapid shipping may find this pace frustrating, but sustainable standards require sustainable decision-making. We optimize for decades, not quarters.

## Demonstration over deliberation

MCP values working implementations over theoretical debates. When evaluating proposals, we prioritize evidence from real-world usage over arguments about hypothetical scenarios. We encourage contributors to prototype, experiment, and demonstrate rather than design by committee. Implementation reveals unknown unknowns.

## Pragmatism over purity

MCP makes practical tradeoffs in service of adoption and usability. We don't pursue theoretical elegance at the cost of real-world utility. When a "correct" design creates friction for implementers, we consider whether a "good enough" design better serves the ecosystem. This means accepting some inconsistency, some historical accidents, and some decisions we might make differently with hindsight.

## Standardization over innovation

MCP's purpose is to standardize patterns that have already proven valuable, not to pioneer novel approaches. We look for existing conventions that work across multiple implementations and codify them — we don't invent new paradigms and hope they'll be adopted.

We encourage the use of [MCP extensions](/extensions/overview) as a way to experiment with new patterns that may eventually lead to standardization.
