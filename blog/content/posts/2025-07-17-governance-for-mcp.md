The Model Context Protocol project has adopted a formal [governance structure](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance) to guide its development.

Since MCP's open source release in November 2024, the project has grown rapidly. Our informal processes haven't scaled with this growth, leading to unclear decision-making and stale pull requests. Today we're addressing these challenges with a formal governance model.

## Governance Structure

The new model establishes three tiers of leadership:

- **Maintainers** manage specific components (SDKs, documentation, repositories)
- **Core Maintainers** guide overall project direction and specification evolution
- **Lead Maintainers** serve as final decision-makers with veto power

All maintainers form the MCP steering group. Core and lead maintainers meet bi-weekly to review [Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)](#specification-enhancement-proposals-seps). Meeting notes and decisions from these meetings will be made public, ensuring transparent governance for the entire community.

## Specification Enhancement Proposals (SEPs)

We're introducing the [Spec Enhancement Proposal](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines) (SEP) as the primary mechanism for proposing changes to MCP, similar to Python's PEPs or Rust's RFCs. Briefly, the SEP process is:

1. Submit a proposal as a GitHub issue
2. Find a steering group sponsor through the [MCP Discord](https://discord.gg/modelcontextprotocol) or GitHub
3. Progress through draft, review, and implementation stages

SEPs ensure thoughtful evolution of the protocol while maintaining an open contribution process.

## Get Involved

We're actively looking for contributors at all levels:

- **New Contributors**: Start with documentation improvements, bug fixes, or examples. Every contribution matters, and we're here to help you get started.

- **SDK Developers**: Help build or maintain SDKs in new languages. We especially need maintainers for emerging language ecosystems.

- **Documentation Writers**: Clear documentation is crucial for MCP's success. Help us improve guides, tutorials, and API references.

- **Future Maintainers**: Show your expertise through consistent contributions. We promote from within our community based on merit and commitment.

Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/modelcontextprotocol) to connect with other contributors, ask questions, and find mentorship. Whether you're fixing typos or proposing protocol changes through SEPs, there's a place for you in the MCP community.
